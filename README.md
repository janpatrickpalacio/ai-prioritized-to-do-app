# AI-Prioritized To-Do App

> "I ship, therefore I am."

This is a test project submission built to demonstrate a "ship fast, iterate faster" mentality.

It's not a standard to-do app; it's an **AI-Prioritized To-Do App**.

Instead of just adding tasks, a user adds a task, and an OpenAI-powered Next.js Server Action automatically analyzes and categorizes it by "Impact" and "Effort." This solves the real-world user problem of "What should I work on next?"

The goal was not pixel-perfection, but to demonstrate shipping valuable software quickly by pragmatically leveraging AI tools.
