1. Use Next.js 14 with App Router
2. Integrate Supabase for authentication and database
3. Use OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for task categorization
4. Implement a priority matrix (3x3 grid) for task visualization
5. Support both list and matrix views
6. Include modern UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
7. Have proper security, performance, and accessibility features

Break down the implementation into logical phases with specific tasks.
```

### Architecture Design Prompt

```
Design the technical architecture for an AI-prioritized task management app with:

- Next.js 14 App Router structure
- Supabase integration for auth and database
- OpenAI API for task analysis

   - ai_priority_score (integer, 1-5)
   - ai_reasoning (text, AI analysis)
   - due_date (timestamp, optional)
   - user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
   - created_at, updated_at (timestamps)

2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
